# CSS Helper
This is a site to generate css code it is very basic but i plan to add to it with more css and animations. 
This site was created so I generate css faster  

## Planned ideas
- Margin and padding setting
- To be able to change units e.g. (px, rem, em, etc...)
- Flex and grid layouts
- Animations
- Css specificity calculator

## More information
Only built for laptop screen for now just wanted to deploy a basic version before cleaning up UI and sorting out screen sized layouts.
