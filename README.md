# CSS Helper
This is a site to generate CSS code it is very basic but I plan to add to it with more CSS and animations. 
This site was created so I generate css faster  

## Planned ideas
- Margin and padding setting
- To be able to change units e.g. (px, rem, em, etc...)
- Flex and grid layouts
- Animations
- CSS specificity calculator
- Improving performance

## Working On
- Refactoring the code to improve performance
- Cleaning up into functions to prevent DRY code
- Cleaning up margins and fixing bugs that happen during it. 

## Known Bugs

- On phones/tablets the UI moves when long text is added to the css block section need to sort out a better way to deal with it on phones/tablets.

## Research
- For the margin section use padding and resize the outer box to represent the margin spacing will do some testing.
