# CSS Helper
This is a site to generate CSS code it is very basic but I plan to add to it with more CSS and animations. 
This site was created so I generate css faster  

## Planned ideas
- Margin and padding setting
- To be able to change units e.g. (px, rem, em, etc...)
- Flex and grid layouts
- Animations
- CSS specificity calculator

## Known Bugs

- On phones/tablets the UI moves when long text is added to the css block section need to sort out a better way to deal with it on phones/tablets.
